I use Cumulative Flow Diagrams for spotting problems and as a communication tool for discussions with the team. It took me a while to work out what to record so that the CFD is most useful for our team's particular context.

Currently, I am using Google Sheets to keep track of how many cards are in each column of our Kanban board. Every morning I have a coffee and add a row for the day before based on the state the board was in when the team stopped working.

The diagram is an "area chart" based on that data. It's kind of a crazy looking diagram, compared to most examples you see. I like that it's idiosyncratic and reflects the peculiar conditions of the team. I value that more than the usual throughput, cycle time and lead time metrics.
