![Are We Agile?](/images/are_we_agile.jpg)

Sometimes I wonder if an organisation I'm working with is agile. There a moments of inspiring agility... and then something happens that's really NOT agile. These obstacles of resistance, well meaning misunderstanding or just plain fear of change sometimes pile up on the "not agile" side of the scale and I think about whether there was some point in the past when I should have said "if you're not willing to try this thing, or accept this thing, then we should stop trying to be agile for a while - call me when you change your mind".
