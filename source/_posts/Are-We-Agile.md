![Are We Agile?](/images/are_we_agile.png)

Sometimes I wonder if an organisation I'm working with is agile. There a moments of inspiring agility... and then something happens that's really NOT agile. These obstacles of resistance, well meaning misunderstanding or just plain fear of change sometimes pile up on the "not agile" side of the scale and I think about whether there was some point in the past when I should have said "if you're not willing to try this thing, or accept this thing, then we should stop trying to be agile for a while - call me when you change your mind".

But I don't do that, I just keep trying. Then, when something goes wrong, there's this moment when all eyes turn to me and someone important says "so, Mr Super Agile, if agile is so great, how did this happen? I _told you_ we should have had a project plan! What have you been doing anyway?"
