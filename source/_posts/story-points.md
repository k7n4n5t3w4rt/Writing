![Story Points](/images/story-points.jpg)

A few years ago I heard about the #NoEstimates hashtag that was causing a noise and confusion on Twitter. I think it was through the [Agile For Humans]() podcast. A bit later I started listening to the [Scrum Master Toolbox]() podcast hosted by [Vasco Duarte](), where the approaches that underpin #NoEstimates come up quite often.\*

Six months ago I started working with two new teams. Though I haven't read Vasco's book, I have read a few blog posts from people I trust to know more than me, like [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement/), and I was intuitively attracted to the idea. \*\*

The teams were new, but everybody seemed to have expectations about how agile development worked. I felt that it would be good for the teams to build up a shared understanding of their agile practice, rather then just import a lot of ideas and techniques that had worked for them in the past. Disrupting expectations around how we would estimate seemed like a good fulcrum on which to pivot around a lot of other pre-conceptions. Also, outside the team, there was a lot of pressure for timelines and project plans etc. I wanted to try to shift the focus onto the delivery of value.

For a while I resisted the word "estimate". That didn't work so well because it meant having a big conversation up front just to explain what we were going to be doing in the meeting. So we had "estimation" meetings. Initially, we estimated with T-shirt sizes because people seemed to need that as a focus for discussion. But gradually that fell away. Thinking back, I was doing 3 things to shift the focus away from the estimate and towards small stories and a deep, shared understanding of each story.

Before asking for a sizing, I asked "is this card ready?"
I shifted from using the words "small", "medium" and "large" to using phrases like "is it as small as it can be...yet?"
Letting some stories through without an agreement on the size, if we agreed that the card was ready and it was as small as it could be

I reported to the team using "throughput", "cycle time", "lead time" metrics derived from a cumulative flow diagram. After a few sprints we were able to forecast future sprint based on average throughput.

Now, instead of "estimating", We use [ATDD](https://www.netobjectives.com/blogs/acceptance-test-driven-development-quick-introduction). The teams still face many challenges but I view not using story points as a key aspect of the success we have had and a fundamental force that is driving the teams towards maturity.

\* Considering that Vasco literally wrote [the book on #NoEstimates]() and is a tireless advocate on Twitter, he is remarkably restrained when interviewing people for the podcast. The actual term "no estimates" rarely makes an appearance and then only with a full disclaimer.

\*\* Also, now that I think about it, my first real experience with Scrum done well was when I worked with a Thoughtworks team here in Sydney. [Juliano Bersano](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/using-points-not-point), in the Thoughtworks analogue to the scrum master role, simply encouraged us to focus on getting stories roughly the same size. I think he used to say they should be "about a day.
