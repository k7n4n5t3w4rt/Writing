CORRECTION: Actually, Martin Fowler says:

> Some teams don't like using story points, preferring instead to use StoryCounting. I don't have a preference between the two - both seem to work equally well so it's up to the team to try out and go with whichever suits them best.

A few years ago I heard about the #NoEstimates hashtag that was causing a noise and confusion on Twitter. I think it was through the [Agile For Humans](https://ryanripley.com/agile-for-humans/) podcast. A bit later I started listening to the [Scrum Master Toolbox podcast hosted by Vasco Duarte](https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/), where the approaches that underpin #NoEstimates come up quite often.\* I read a few classic blog posts from people I trust, like [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement/) and [Josh Kerievsky](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/), and I was intuitively attracted to the idea. \*\*

Six months ago I started working with two new teams. Everybody seemed to have expectations about how agile development worked. I felt that it would be good for the teams to build up a shared understanding of their agile practice, rather then just import a lot of ideas and techniques that had worked for them in the past. Disrupting expectations around how we would estimate seemed like a good fulcrum on which to pivot around a lot of other pre-conceptions. Also, outside the team, there was a lot of pressure for timelines and project plans etc. I wanted to try to shift the focus onto the delivery of value.

For a while I resisted the word "estimate". That didn't work so well because it meant having a big conversation up front just to explain what we were going to be doing in the meeting. So we had "estimation" meetings. Initially, we estimated with T-shirt sizes because people seemed to need that as a focus for discussion. But gradually that fell away. Thinking back, I was doing 3 things to shift the focus away from the estimate and towards small stories and a deep, shared understanding of each story.

- Before asking for a sizing, I asked "is this card ready?"
- I shifted from using the words "small", "medium" and "large" to using phrases like "is it as small as it can be...yet?"
- I let some stories sit without a clear agreement on the size, if we agreed that the card was ready and it was as small as it could be - I would just move on to discussing another card

I reported to the team using "throughput", "cycle time", "lead time" metrics derived from a cumulative flow diagram. After a few sprints we were able to forecast future sprints based on average throughput.

Now, instead of "estimation meetings", we have [ATDD](https://www.netobjectives.com/blogs/acceptance-test-driven-development-quick-introduction) sessions. The teams still face many challenges but I view not using story points as a key aspect of the success we have had and a fundamental force that is driving the teams towards maturity.

I guess we're doing #NoEstimates but talking about it like that gets people very confused and angry. This seems to be because people assume that #NoEstimates means never giving the business a forecast, which is [not a correct assumption](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/015-jul/what-estimates-are-not/). In any case, I'm not an expert in the #NoEstimates approach - I just think many teams could benefit from dropping the idea of story points.

\* Considering that Vasco literally wrote [the book on #NoEstimates](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30650836-noestimates) and is a tireless proponent of the idea, he is remarkably restrained when interviewing people for the podcast. The actual term "no estimates" rarely makes an appearance and then only with a full disclaimer.

\*\* Also, now that I think about it, my first real experience with Scrum done well was when I worked with a Thoughtworks team here in Sydney. [Juliano Bersano](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/using-points-not-point), in the Thoughtworks analogue to the scrum master role, simply encouraged us to focus on getting stories roughly the same size. I think he used to say they should be "about a day.
