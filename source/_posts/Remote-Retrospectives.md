![The 5 Stages of a Remote Retrospective](/images/remote_retro.jpg)

I've never been very confident going into a retrospective meeting. I recently, and very belatedly, read _Agile Retrospectives_ by Diana Larsen and Esther Derby [Larsen, D. & Derby, E. 2006] and realised the importance of really covering the five stages they recommend. It gives the retro a solid structure and makes me more confident about trying new approaches within the structure.

At the moment I'm working with remote teams, so I naturally tried to translate the approach to our retrospectives, which we do over HangOut and using https://realtimeboard.com/. The results are sometimes frustrating, often hilarious and always worthwhile.
