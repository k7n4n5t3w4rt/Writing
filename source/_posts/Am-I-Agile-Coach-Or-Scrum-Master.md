I recently did the Product Owner certification with Agile Alliance. I've worked with teams in the role of Scrum Master but not directly as Product Owner. It was a great course and I learned a lot.

The trainer, a very experienced agile practitioner, expressed some annoyance about people calling themselves "Agile Coach". He spoke of the high status that a Scrum Master used to have, which has shifted to the Agile Coach. He said "Do you know how much training you need to be an Agile Coach? None".

In fact I have found that there is plenty of [training and learning I can do to help me be a better Agile Coach](http://www.coachingagileteams.com/about/) in the same way that there is plenty for me to learn about doing Scrum.

If your organisation is doing scrum, whether "Agile Coach" is your job title or "Scrum Master" is your job title, you may well have the responsibility of being Scrum Master on a Scrum team for your organisation. You may also support the developers and the Product Owner on the scrum team with coaching and facilitation. You may work with the whole organisation to influence the system conditions that allow agile teams to thrive.

One anti-pattern I have seen is when an organisation has people with the "Agile Coach" job title and people with "Scrum Master" job title. In this case, the Scrum Master works at a team level and the Agile Coach works across teams or with the management team. In this case the Agile Coach has more rank because of who they mix with and the Scrum Master role is seen as being about "delivery". This pattern is common in government departments who are in the business of "transformation".

When it's a straight choice about whether the role should be called "Agile Coach" or "Scrum Master" then the question is surely about whether the team (and the organisation as a whole) wants to commit to only doing Scrum. Personally, I think Scrum can be immensely valuable but I have also suggested not doing scrum at certain times when it felt right to try a different approach.

I would rather be called "Agile Coach" because it encourages a more flexible mindset, and because it stresses the coaching aspect of the role. Coaching is about supporting others to develop capability and that's something I want to keep in focus.
