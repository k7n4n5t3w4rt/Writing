I recently did the Product Owner certification with Agile Alliance. I've worked with teams in the role of Scrum Master but not directly as Product Owner. It was a great course and I learned a lot.

The trainer, a very experienced agile practitioner, expressed some annoyance about people calling themselves "Agile Coach". He spoke of the high status that a Scrum Master used to have, which has shifted to the Agile Coach. He said "Do you know how much training you need to be an Agile Coach? None".

If "Agile Coach" is your job title, you may well have the responsibility of being Scrum Master on a Scrum team for your organisation. You may also support the developers and the Product Owner on the scrum team. You may work with the whole organisation to improve the system conditions that allow agile teams to thrive.

If your job title is "Scrum Master" you might do exactly the same things but, if your organisation is not exclusively doing Scrum, the "Scrum Master" title doesn't make sense. With the "Scrum Master" as your job title, it's going to be hard for you to coach people who think of themselves as being "Lean", "Modern Agile" or "XP".

There is plenty of [training and learning I can do to help me be a better Agile Coach](http://www.coachingagileteams.com/about/) and plenty for me to learn about doing Scrum. I'm going to call myself "Agile Coach" when I can and "Scrum Master" when the context is Scrum.
