Like most systematic thinkers (thanks [Nick Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii3yAYwmNq8&feature=youtu.be&t=237)), I have a lot of ideas, some of which I do. A few of those ideas are about what I do for a living. The result is that I do lots of different things. I'm a developer, an agile coach and a product manager. In semi-professional life I'm an artist.

When I think about my career, I think about what I can learn and what else I can do. I'm not what you'd call focused. I'm pretty useful to have around but if you ask me what I do I'll probably sound like I'm generalising.

Softare products and services need a business goal. We know who the product is for, the problems it solves for them and why it's better than the alternative. This is the sort of [value proposition statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06mXzzd8Hhs&feature=youtu.be&t=35) we need to articulate so we can make good decisions during the long and complex process of making software:

FOR `<target customer>`
WHO `<statement of need>`
THE PRODUCT IS A `<product category>`
THAT `<key benefit, compelling reason to buy>`
UNLIKE `<key competition>`
THE PRODUCT `<compelling statement of differentiation>`

Maybe one day I'll be a product and with a single value proposition. Something to guide my decisions during the long and complex process of being alive. In the meantime, I can think of myself as different related, products. I made some value proposition statements for myself and put them on my [CV](https://kynan.net.au).

Now I need a Lean Canvas for each product.
