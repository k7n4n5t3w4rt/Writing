Software products and services need a business goal. We also need to know who the product is for, the problems it solves for them and why it's better than the alternative. This is the sort of [value proposition statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06mXzzd8Hhs&feature=youtu.be&t=35) we need to articulate so that we can make good decisions during the long and complex process of making software:

> FOR `<target customer>`
> WHO `<statement of need>`
> THE PRODUCT IS A `<product category>`
> THAT `<key benefit, compelling reason to buy>`
> UNLIKE `<key competition>`
> THE PRODUCT `<compelling statement of differentiation>`
