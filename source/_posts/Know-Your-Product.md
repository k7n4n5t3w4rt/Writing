Like most systematic thinkers (thanks [Nick Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii3yAYwmNq8&feature=youtu.be&t=237)), I have a lot of ideas, some of which I do. A few of those ideas are about me. The result is that I do lots of different things. In my professional life I'm a developer, an agile coach and a product manager. In semi-professional life, or past-lives, I'm an artist, a musician and a cartoonist.

When I think about my career, I think about what I can learn and what else I can do. I'm not what you'd call focused. I'm pretty useful to have around but if you ask me what I do I'll stuggle to tell you.

When I help people make products and services, we all know the business goal that's driving the product. We also know who the product is for, the problems it is solving for them and why it's different and better than the alternative. This is the sort of [value proposition statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06mXzzd8Hhs&feature=youtu.be&t=35) we need to make good decisions during the long and complex process of making software:

FOR `<target customer>`
WHO `<statement of need>`
THE PRODUCT IS A `<product category>`
THAT `<key benefit, compelling reason to buy>`
UNLIKE `<key competition>`
THE PRODUCT `<compelling statement of differentiation>`

I'm a product. Maybe one day I'll have a clear vision of myself and the value I provide. Something to guide my decisions during the long and complex process of being alive.

In the meantime, the best I can do is think of myself as a bunch of different products. I made some value proposiion statements for myself and put them on my [CV](https://kynan.net.au)
