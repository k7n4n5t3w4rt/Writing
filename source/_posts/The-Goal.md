From experience, I know what happens when we try to make a product without having a clear goal - nothing. We can go through the motions and waste a lot of time but we'll never find value in what we're doing. If we manage to make anything at all, nobody will buy it.

I went fishing the other day. I wanted to sit out on the wharf and fish. Sure, I wanted to catch something but I didn't really care what.

I caught a stonefish. After the blue-ringed octopus I caught that time, this is the most deadly thing around here. Stonefish have poisonous spines. They are for stepping on and dying, not for catching.

The real fisher-folk around here always know what they're fishing for. They come at the right time, with the right rig and the right bait. Maybe they still get the odd stonefish but their chances of getting what they want are pretty good too, because they actually know what it is.
