I know what happens when you try to make a product without having a clear goal - nothing. You can go through the motions and waste a lot of time but you'll never be able to find value in what you're doing. If you manage to make anything at all, nobody will buy it.

I went fishing the other day. I wanted to sit out on the wharf and fish. I wanted to catch something but I didn't really care what.

I caught a stonefish. After the blue-ringed octopus, this is the most deadly thing I've caught around here. Stonefish have poisonous spines. Very. Poisonous. They are for stepping on and dying, not for catching. [1]

The real fisherfolk around here always know what they're fishing for. They come at the right time, with the right rig and the right bait to catch what they're after.

Some people just catch blackfish. Blackfish are caught on a super light rig with a bait of seaweed. In a particular area, the blackfish will take one sort of seaweed and nothing else. Nothing else will bite on seaweed. The chances of catching a blackfish are actually pretty good, if you know what you're doing. Your chances of catching anything else when you're going for blackfish are zero.

Now that's a goal.
