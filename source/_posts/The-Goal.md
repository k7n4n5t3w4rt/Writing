I know what happens when we try to make a product without having a clear goal - nothing. We can go through the motions and waste a lot of time but we'll never be able to find value in what we're doing. If we manage to make anything at all, nobody will buy it.

I went fishing the other day. I wanted to sit out on the wharf and fish. I wanted to catch something but I didn't really care what.

I caught a stonefish. After the blue-ringed octopus, this is the most deadly thing I've caught around here. Stonefish have poisonous spines. Very. Poisonous. They are for stepping on and dying, not for catching.

The real fisherfolk around here always know what they're fishing for. They come at the right time, with the right rig and the right bait to catch what they're after. Maybe they'll still get the odd stonefish but the chances of getting what they want are pretty good.
