![Story Points](/images/story-points-v4.jpg)

Six months ago I started working with two new teams. Everybody seemed to have expectations about how agile development worked. I felt that it would be good for the teams to build up a shared understanding of their agile practice, rather then just import a lot of ideas and techniques that had worked for them in the past. Disrupting expectations around how we would estimate seemed like a good fulcrum on which to pivot around a lot of other pre-conceptions. Also, outside the team, there was a lot of pressure for timelines and project plans etc. I wanted to try to shift the focus onto the delivery of value.

Thinking back, I was doing 3 things to shift the focus away from the idea of an estimate and towards small stories and a deep, shared understanding of each story:

- Before asking for any kind of size or complexity estimate, I asked "is this card ready?"
- I shifted from using the words "small", "medium" and "large" to using phrases like "is it as small as it can be...yet?" If we agreed that the card was ready and that it was as small as it could be, I would suggest moving on to another card, even if we didn't have an estimate
- I reported to the team using "throughput", "cycle time" and "lead time" - metrics derived from a cumulative flow diagram and not reliant on any points estimate

Surprisingly quickly, the teams became focused on having smaller stories. Smaller stories are better understood and, of course, quicker to complete. Within the wider team, there has been a gradual acceptance that forecasts are built on understanding and take time. People are starting to realise that working together with the development team is worth the effort. We do ATDD sessions now, instead of "estimation meetings".

The teams still face many challenges but not using story points is a key aspect of the successes we have had and a fundamental force that is driving the teams towards maturity.

#### A note on #NoEstimates

I'm not an expert in the #NoEstimates approach - I just think many teams could benefit from dropping the idea of story points.

Now that I think about it, my first real experience with Scrum done well was when I worked with a Thoughtworks team here in Sydney. [Juliano Bersano](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/using-points-not-point), in the Thoughtworks analogue to the scrum master role, simply encouraged us to focus on getting stories roughly the same size. I think he used to say they should be "about a day".

A few years ago I heard about the #NoEstimates hashtag that was causing a noise and confusion on Twitter. I think it was through the [Agile For Humans](https://ryanripley.com/agile-for-humans/) podcast. A bit later I started listening to the [Scrum Master Toolbox podcast hosted by Vasco Duarte](https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/), where the approaches that underpin #NoEstimates come up quite often. Considering that Vasco literally wrote [the book on #NoEstimates](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30650836-noestimates) and is a tireless proponent of the idea, he is remarkably restrained on the podcast.

I read a few classic blog posts from people like [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement/) and [Josh Kerievsky](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/).
