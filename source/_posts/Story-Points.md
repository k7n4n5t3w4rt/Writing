![Story Points](/images/story-points-v2.jpg)

A few years ago I heard about the #NoEstimates hashtag that was causing a noise and confusion on Twitter. I think it was through the [Agile For Humans](https://ryanripley.com/agile-for-humans/) podcast. A bit later I started listening to the [Scrum Master Toolbox podcast hosted by Vasco Duarte](https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/), where the approaches that underpin #NoEstimates come up quite often.\* I read a few classic blog posts from people like [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement/) and [Josh Kerievsky](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/).\*\*

Six months ago I started working with two new teams. Everybody seemed to have expectations about how agile development worked. I felt that it would be good for the teams to build up a shared understanding of their agile practice, rather then just import a lot of ideas and techniques that had worked for them in the past. Disrupting expectations around how we would estimate seemed like a good fulcrum on which to pivot around a lot of other pre-conceptions. Also, outside the team, there was a lot of pressure for timelines and project plans etc. I wanted to try to shift the focus onto the delivery of value.

For a while I resisted the word "estimate". That didn't work so well because it meant having a big conversation before we could even have a meeting. So I booked in regular "estimation" meetings. Initially, we used T-shirt sizes because people seemed to need that as a focus for discussion. But gradually that fell away.

Thinking back, I was doing 3 things to shift the focus away from the estimate and towards small stories and a deep, shared understanding of each story:

- Before asking for a T-shirt sizing, I asked "is this card ready?"
- I shifted from using the words "small", "medium" and "large" to using phrases like "is it as small as it can be...yet?"
- I let some stories sit without a clear agreement on the size, if we agreed that the card was ready and it was as small as it could be - I would just move on to discussing another card

I reported to the team using "throughput", "cycle time", "lead time" - metrics derived from a cumulative flow diagram. After a few sprints we were able to forecast future sprints based on average throughput.

Surprisingly quickly, the teams became very focused on having smaller stories. Smaller stories are better understood and, of course, quicker to complete. Because we never had a backlog of poorly understood stories with large story point estimates, we couldn't give impressive sounding but vague predictions about when work would be be completed in the future. Outside the teams, there was a gradual acceptance that forecasts are built on understanding and take time. People are starting to realise that working together with the development team is worth the effort. We do ATDD sessions now, instead of "estimation meetings".

The teams still face many challenges but not using story points is a key aspect of the successes we have had and a fundamental force that is driving the teams towards maturity.

I guess we're doing #NoEstimates but talking about it like that gets people very confused and angry. This seems to be because people assume that #NoEstimates means never giving the business a forecast, which is [not a correct assumption](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/015-jul/what-estimates-are-not/). In any case, I'm not an expert in the #NoEstimates approach - I just think many teams could benefit from dropping the idea of story points.

\* Considering that Vasco literally wrote [the book on #NoEstimates](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30650836-noestimates) and is a tireless proponent of the idea, he is remarkably restrained when interviewing people for the podcast. The actual term "no estimates" rarely makes an appearance and then only with a full disclaimer.

\*\* Also, now that I think about it, my first real experience with Scrum done well was when I worked with a Thoughtworks team here in Sydney. [Juliano Bersano](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/using-points-not-point), in the Thoughtworks analogue to the scrum master role, simply encouraged us to focus on getting stories roughly the same size. I think he used to say they should be "about a day.
