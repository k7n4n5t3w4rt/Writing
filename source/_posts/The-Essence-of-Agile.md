![The Essence of Agile?](/images/essence_of_agile.png)

I hear people say that agile is a commodity. I think it's true to some extent. The real, authentic agile still exists but there is another agile that is more about off-the-shelf practices. In large organisations in particular, this can be what agile is. It works to some extent. It's fine. Personally I need to connect with something deeper. It's just how I'm wired. I always try to pull things back to the principles and values which are the essence of agile.
